## Understanding `useDebounce`

In modern web applications, performance and user experience are critical. One common challenge is handling events that fire rapidly, like typing in a search bar. The `useDebounce` hook is a powerful tool to manage these scenarios efficiently.

### What is Debouncing?

> **Debouncing** is a performance optimization technique that delays the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed *without* that function being called again.

Imagine a live search bar that fetches data from an API. Without debouncing, every single keystroke would trigger a new API call. If a user types "React," the application would make five separate requests for "R," "Re," "Rea," "Reac," and "React." This is inefficient and can overload your server.

Debouncing solves this by waiting for the user to pause. It starts a timer on each keystroke, and if a new keystroke occurs, it resets the timer. The API call is only made once the timer successfully completes.

### The Custom Hook Code

Here is the complete code for a reusable `useDebounce` hook. It's built using fundamental React hooks that are essential to understand.

```javascript
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

export const useDebounce = (callback, delay) => {
    const timeoutIdRef = useRef(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        // Return a cleanup function to clear the timer when the component unmounts
        return () => {
            if (timeoutIdRef.current) {
                clearTimeout(timeoutIdRef.current);
            }
        };
    }, []);

    const debouncedCallback = (...args) => {
        // If a timer is already running, cancel it
        if (timeoutIdRef.current) {
            clearTimeout(timeoutIdRef.current);
        }

        // Set a new timer
        timeoutIdRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
            callback(...args);
        }, delay);
    };

    return debouncedCallback;
};
